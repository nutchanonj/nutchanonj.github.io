# CUEE Study Guide by Nutchanon J

{: .note } 
For answering this, I decide to write it as the Q&A so that it is more engaging.

{: .warning } 
DISCLAIMER: you don't have to do all of these. These are only my suggestion. The expectation from studying are varied between people. So, you don't have to do all these things.

### Q1: Should I just learn the materials, or just do the exercises and former exams?

A1: TL; DR: Do both.

I would like to say that, ideally, the exams of a course should be the feedback of how much you understand the coursework. But no prof could give you many times of feedback since s/he has no time. Hence, you must feedback yourself how much you have learnt by doing exercises and former exams by yourself. It may be true that you can do those things without fully understanding the concepts of a coursework, but it not worth to do that. Some (many) courses are the pre-requisite for the subsequence courses, that some (or many) misunderstanding from the prior course(s) would be some (big) burden for you in the future. Therefore, you should have time to contemplate about the concepts taught in the courses to understand those to the cores. It supposes to take time.

### Q2: Should I rely only on professor’s materials, or should I study further in the associated textbook(s)?

A2: It’s depended on how difficult the exams are, or how much quality of teaching in the course, or ultimately, how much you want to learn.

I would like to say that for 2nd year courses, quality of teaching is still very good. Rely on attending the class and do your HWs/exercises/former exams should be enough; textbooks are used for curiosity. Until 3rd year that some courses are taught in an ill-manner way, that you have to rely on textbook(s) for that course. You can rely on my CUEE courses review to see the recommended textbooks for each course.

---

### Q3: Textbook is very hard to read. What is the recommended way to learn from textbook?

A3: This is my recommendation:
-	Step 1: Study from the course materials first to see the keywords or key concepts of the course.
-	Step 2: Skim through the textbook to see how the content in a textbook associate with the keywords or key concepts of the course. This way, you will have some prior idea or picture of the content, and it will help you with the process of comprehension from the textbook.
-	Step 3: Read it thoroughly.

I would like to say that for each course, you don’t have to read the entire textbook. Read just some parts of it that are not beyond your *frontier of knowledge*. 

I also recommended that some courses really need professors to guide what you must learn from a course (a.k.a., the key concepts.) It’s faster to learn this way.

Also, there will be textbooks that your love and you hate, e.g., some of textbooks are readable for you but some aren’t. I recommend that you read some of its chapters to determine whether you are ok with the book or not. That is why in my CUEE courses review, there are some courses that I recommend 2-3 books so you can choose them for your favor.

---

### Q4: You mentioned the *frontier of knowledge* in the last Q&A. What is it?

A4: There will be time that you read the textbook and not understand it at all. It indicates that this content is beyond your *frontier of knowledge*.

For concrete example, suppose that you want to read about microelectronics from Sedra & Smith. At some point, you need to know some concepts from LIN CON SYS I (root locus, Nyquist’s stability criterions, etc.) to understand how the feedback in circuits works. Surely, there will be a brief review about those topics, but it will assume that you already know those, so the review is very succinct and unfriendly to the novice.

What can you do about this situation? One of the ways is that you have to learn about LIN CON SYS I concept first from professors. What if you are hurry? Then, you need to read LIN CON SYS I by yourself. Maybe from Ogata or Dorf. What if you don’t understand those text by reading yourself? Consult the EE Math II materials what you don’t really understand. This process is recursive as explained. This requires patience and time.

---

### Q5: I am not good at English reading. How can I learn from textbooks which are mostly written in English?

A5: Then you read the textbook. Everyone must start somewhere. If you don’t know the word, use the dictionary, and note the meaning in the book directly. You will thank yourself later when you have to take TOEIC, TOEFL or IELTS before applying for jobs or graduate admissions, or when you have to read a fuckton of research papers in the 4th year. I agree with you that if you are not good at English, reading textbook will take much more time, but it worth it. You will thank yourself later.

---

### Q6: Should I buy the textbook, or print it out from downloaded (pirated) file, or just read it on iPad?

A6: You can use www Dot libgen DOT rs to load the textbooks. (Pirated.) Don’t forget to sort by year so you can get the latest edition of the book. If you are going to read a lot, print it; your eyes are precious. If you can afford the book or you’re very appreciated the writer, then you buy the book.

However, I don’t recommend you buy the book before downloading it and reading its some chapters. This is because you don’t know yet if the book is really for you. Again, there will be textbooks that your love and you hate, e.g., some of textbooks are readable for you but some aren’t. So, I recommend that you read some of its chapters to determine whether you are ok with the book or not before buying it. In addition, the library of Chula Engineering has many great textbooks (not kidding, some are out-of-date editions but still very good resources) that you can lend, so you can be frugal.

Also, there will be time that Chula Book Center dumps the price of their international textbooks to insanely low price. (I had an experience that the price of Cryptography and Network Security by Stalling was sold at 99 baht!?) The promotion usually takes place at the end of each year. So, go check the prices; you may lucky!

### Q7: Reading textbook(s) is a very heavy task, should I really read the textbook(s)?

A7: Yes. This is the undergrad, not a school.

---

### Q8: One textbook for a course is enough or not?

A8: Usually not. You can see from my CUEE courses review that I recommend 2-3 books so you can use them parallelly in a course. Surely there will be one main textbook that you read, but the other are also essential as the additional references. This is the way of study; one textbook is usually not enough to understand the course. Fortunately, this is the age of the Internet (and lots of pirated textbooks.)

---

### Q9: Is the academic integrity really matter? Do professors really do the investigation and punishment(s) when there is a misconduct in academic integrity?

A9: There is a chance that you will get caught, and it is never worth it. DO NOT CHEAT, EVEN COPYING HWs! Especially for some professors (e.g., JSS,) the consequence is not worth it at all.

![course-policy-exampl](\images\course-policy-exampl.png)
 
Do you think this HW policy is long and tedious? The answer is not. For the prestigious universities, like UC Berkeley, the 3-page-long document for Academic Misconduct Policy is very common. You can see the example [here](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/guides/academic-misconduct/).

{: .warning }
I have warn you. It's not worth it.

### Q10: I have finished the 2nd year now and still hesitate about which majors should I choose. (Power, Communication, Electronics, Control System.) Is that normal?

A10: Yes. However, you should finally decide after finishing the 1st semester of 3rd year, in which you will learn all the fundamentals in those four majors. Trust me, at that time you will know what you really want to study.

---

### Q11: Can I choose 3 majors in (Power, Communication, Electronics, Control System?)

A11: Yes. There are people in the past who can do that. Personally, I do not recommend you do that since you will not have time to take the non-compulsory electives, that you will know things like a duck in three fields.

---

### Q12: There are too many electives that I want to learn. Should I take more than 22 credits per semester so I can learn all of those?

A12: You can, but it is not recommended. Even if you really want to do so, taking beyond 23-24 credits will be considered heavily by the registrar. The process will take like 1 to 2 months, and you have to declare explicitly why you really want to take that many credits (mine is 2-page long document.)

Even if you can get through that tedious process, taking beyond 22 credits will exhaust your time too much that you will hate yourself. Also, your health will be deteriorated.

My recommendation is that you only take the courses which you really want to understand, or that you cannot self-study. You don’t have to know everything!!

### Q13: How much GPAX is great?

A13: Would like to say that GPAX above 3.80 is already very great, beyond that is not significant anymore. Takes time for other things (competition, self-study, internship, part-time paid or unpaid work) are better. Also, please note that if you want to study Master at the top U. (internationally) in the future, immediately after graduation, GPAX is important. Some U. declare the average GPAX of the admitted students. For example, U. of Melbourne has the admitted Master students with the average GPAX of about 3.7-3.8 (IIRC.)

---

### Q14: What should I prepare if I want to study Master in a top international university in the future (after graduation?)

**GPAX** – Above 3.80 and you should be fine. Below this is also fine if you have strong background (internships, research works, activities, competitions, etc.) Good luck.

**English assessments** – TOEFL and IELTS are both fine. Universities in both U.S. and U.K./E.U. are now generally accept both tests. TOEFL 100 is recommended. Also, each part (writing, speaking, listening, reading) should be more than 22, and you are safe. This is from my searching through lots of (more than 50) universities’ admission requirements. The exam result (both TOEFL and IELTS) can be kept for 2 years.

P.S. If you want to talk with computer, take TOEFL. In contrast, If you want to talk with human, take IEFLS. The costs are not different that much.

**GRE** – Some universities require you to take this test. There are three sections: Verbal, Quantitative, and Analytical. Verbal section is like an English test; its vocabs are difficult and not found in everyday life. Quantitative section is like an easy math test that you, the EE student, should be fine. Analytical section is a critical-thinking-kind-of writing test. I personally have not taken the exam yet. This exam requires lots of preparation. The exam result can be kept for 5 years.

The other important things are your activities and internships. I recommend that you also have those in the portfolio.

For others, you can prepare it at the time of application (letter of recommendations, statement of purpose, passport, and your picture; those take not so much time.) I will talk about those later in another post.
