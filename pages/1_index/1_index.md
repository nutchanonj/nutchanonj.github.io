## 我的姓名是什麽？

My Chinese name is 王哲生. My family (both of my father and mother sides) immigrate from China to Thailand during the rise of Chinese communist. Thus, my father already has a Chinese surname “Heng” in Teochew or “Wang (王)” in Mandarin Chinese. The name 哲生 is translate directly from my Thai name “Nutchanon (ณัฐชนน)” (born to be a philosopher.)
