Hi! My name is Nutchanon Jariyanurut. I’m currently studying as a first year master's student at [Graduate School of Advanced Technology](https://gsat.ntu.edu.tw/tw/home/), [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in the Program for Integrated Circuit Design and Automation. Currently I'm working under supervision of [Prof. Lee Tai-Cheng](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=79). My topic is mainly about RF energy harvesting. 

From 2019 to 2023, I was studying at [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.eng.chula.ac.th/), [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.eng.chula.ac.th/th/), [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/).

My interests are electronics (especially analog and digital design,) control systems, and anything related to maths in general (including AI, ML and data analytics.)

My spirit animal is in a phylum of [Cnidaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria).

## 我的姓名是什麽？

My Chinese name is 王哲生. My family (both of my father and mother sides) immigrate from China to Thailand during the rise of Chinese communist. Thus, my father already has a Chinese surname “Heng” in Teochew or “Wang (王)” in Mandarin Chinese. The name 哲生 is translate directly from my Thai name “Nutchanon (ณัฐชนน)” (born to be a philosopher.)
