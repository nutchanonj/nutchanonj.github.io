# My Journey on Digital IC Design

This page is for documenting my work on practicing digital IC design and layout. The softwares I use are

- Layouting: Microwind 3.1 (This software is very old but it's only what my faculty provided.)
- Initial design and behavioral simulation: Xilinx Vivado 2022.1
