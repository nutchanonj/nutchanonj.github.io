# About me! :wave:

## Background

My name is Nutchanon Jariyanurut. I'm from Chonburi, Thailand. The city where I live is Bang Saen. It's kinda like a travelers' attraction with the very beautiful beach. (I recommend you to go there in winter; the sea water is very dirty during monsoon season.) You can see how Bang Saen is [here](https://web.facebook.com/shopjungbangsaen/).

For over 9 years in primary and secondary education, I was studying at [Satit Demonstration School](http://www.st.buu.ac.th/).

## High School

*Mahidol Wittayanusorn School*

In high school, I was studying in a very STEM-oriented, [Mahidol Wittayanusorn School](https://www.mwit.ac.th/html/). There, I was in the National Chemistry Olympiad Team. I received silver medal in [13th Thailand Chemistry Olympiad in 2017](https://web.facebook.com/NonJariyanurut/posts/pfbid02VfekkqrG7oJrweQ4zUk3wekvBRFt1kEoV2tkzJEZmTgF9LZJMmAfJYd8Pr2KsVM4l) (I didn't make it to the international Olympiad, though.)

In 2017, I was participating in [International Chemistry Tournament](http://ichto.org/en/). It is the competition where participants solve the open-ended chemistry problems provided by the tournament, and the scoring is based on debating with scientific foundation. That year the tournament took place in originating country, Russia. I received a [best presentation award](http://ichto.org/en/the-results-of-the-ichto-2017/).

During my high school years, The science project I conducted was *[Development of wood density measuring instrument by determining the speed of stress wave in wood with piezoelectric effect](https://www.nstda.or.th/sims/login/index.php?class=AbstractProposalView&id=29)*. It was presented in [TISF 2019](https://www.facebook.com/TISF2021/), [ASMS International Science Fair 2018](https://asms.sa.edu.au/international-science-fair/), and [YSC 2018](http://fic.nectec.or.th/ysc20_Decisions). In the YSC, it received special award in the field of engineering and physics science project.

## Undergrad

*Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University (at night)*

From 2019 to 2023, I was studying in [Dept. of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.eng.chula.ac.th/), at [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/). My interests are electronics (especially digital and analog design,) control systems, and anything related to maths in general (including AI, ML and data analytics.)

My second and third years in the university, I was an active member in [Engineering Student Committee](https://web.facebook.com/escchula). My work there was primarily in academical affair. I organized [Introduction to 10 Departmants in Faculty](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb-1vsRR1f1t0EjhCzYgxKQwaf6OssHM0) for 1st year students and the [Intania Job Fair 2022](https://web.facebook.com/escchula/posts/pfbid031wCoLjDPfAfX3XMzcsZA6UDio5GoGfKqqecDtqwC6gruwHCE1a7p4ajGcBWo4Ztnl). The post includes the LINE OpenChat invitation link for job lining that is (as of Oct. 2022) still active, so if you want to find Thai engineering jobs, you may get into there.

I was a working member in [Larngear Camp](https://web.facebook.com/LARNGEARCAMP) for three years. (19th, 20th, 21th.) The camp is for Thai high school students who want to know about engineering, both academical and professional things. The camp takes place for 3 days. In the last years I organized the workshop of 18 departments of the faculty in the camp as the head of the academic team. 

I also was a chemistry teaching staff in [FE Camp](https://web.facebook.com/fecampchula) for three years. (13th, 14th, 15th.) This camp is for teaching Thai high school students, preparing them for the national engineering entrance exams.

In the third year, I was an active member in [Engineering Innovator Club](https://web.facebook.com/eicchulalongkorn), or EIC Chula. The club participated in [RoboCup 2022 @Home Open Platform League](https://athome.robocup.org/2022-qualified-teams/), where I was in the [Electrical Team](https://www.eicrobocup.com/about). My responsibility was to implement the motor drive (the club decided to use [Odrive 3.6](https://odriverobotics.com/shop/odrive-v36)) to use in the robot and made it able to communicate with ROS. My minor work was also publishing the [team description paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dtkkcmtjsnhs) in LaTeX. The robot received [the second place](https://web.facebook.com/eicchulalongkorn/posts/pfbid0G8739WaddDdwjz6hTpuKEZzS6EJv2jbwJjxcvp95mNeM8GFnCQXtej2Jvu3p8wZ6l) in the league. S/he also has [his/her own instagram](https://www.instagram.com/walkie_eic/).

During December 2021, I was participating in [Digital Design Thailand Camp 2021](https://www.facebook.com/DigitalDesignThailand/), where I learned about FPGA and digital design, made TX/RX UART modules, and an interface to receive bitmap file on a computer and display it on an HDMI monitor.

## Internship & Senior Projects

Before the fourth year, I had an internship at [Silicon Craft Technology PLC](https://www.sic.co.th/). My works are designing two-stage op-amp to meet the required specifications, with Python coding to automate and accelerate the process, and also  literature review on wireless power transfer technology utilizing NFC frequency.

My Senior Project is the continuation from my internship work, that is, designing wireless power transfer system utilizing NFC frequency.

## Graduates
